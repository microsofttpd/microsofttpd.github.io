Their call is finally answered and we now have the documentation for Management Reporter for Dynamics ERP available publicly in TechNet.</p>
<p>It can be accessed from the URL given below.</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn435963.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn435963.aspx</a></p>
<p>Moving the documentation to TechNet provides several benefits including:</p>
<ul>
<li>All help content is now searchable and will show up in your favorite search engine results</li>
<li>Enhanced feedback capabilities. If the help content is not providing the information you need, leave a comment through the feedback link on the appropriate page on what could be improved and what you were looking for</li>
<li>Content updates can be performed outside of product releases. Updates made to the website can be performed more frequently than what could be done with the help files that shipped with Management Reporter</li>
</ul>
<p>Other Management Reporter documentation including installation guides, migration wizard documentation, and data integration guides will continue to be available as downloads on the Microsoft Download Center <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5916" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Corporate Performance Management team for making this available to all! I hope this is helpful to all who are looking at documentation for this product.</p>
<p>Until next post!</p>
