<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage" href="/b/DynamicsPTS"><img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage" src="https://microsofttpd.github.io/assets/0871.sivav.jpg" width="80" align="right" height="95" /></a>In Management Reporter, we have a functionality to create Dimension Sets with specific dimensions available. These dimension sets help to minimize and show only the dimensions available in a specific Dimension Set when we open the Link to Financial Dimensions window from the Row Definition. This will be typically useful if there are many dimensions and you generally use a few of them to filter when designing reports. This way the Dimensions window is not filled with all the dimensions (and using up the window space), instead show only the relevant dimensions in this window.</p>
<p>However, one limitation of the Dimension Set is that this filter does not apply for the Insert Rows from Dimensions window in the Row Definition. This product suggestion has been created to suggest the addition of the Dimension Set filter in the Insert Rows from Dimensions window in the Row Definition.</p>
<p>This product suggestion can be accessed from the link below.</p>
