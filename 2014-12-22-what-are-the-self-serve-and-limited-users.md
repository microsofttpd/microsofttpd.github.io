<p>We have been getting a lot of questions like: What can a self serve user do?&nbsp; What can a limited user do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>From a high level a Self Serve user can create requisitions, enter time and expenses, enter project time and expenses, benefits self service and workflow.&nbsp; The limited user can do what a self serve can do plus all inquiry, reports and SmartLists.</p>
<p>Until next post!</p>
