Changes to how currency translation works for GP are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The account category is no longer required for Retained Earnings. The translation now uses the original document information to properly calculate the translated values.</li>
<li>Posting to Retained Earnings is also now supported. The ability to isolate posting to Retained Earnings using the originating document information allows the balances to now properly translate.</li>
<li>Expiration dates for all methods are now honored.</li>
<li>The Average method, or Rate Average in Dynamics GP, will now use a rate defined in a prior period, as long as the rate is not expired.</li>
<li>The quality issue surrounding using one rate for Retained Earnings has been addressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope thus helps&hellip;</p>
<p>Until next post!</p>
