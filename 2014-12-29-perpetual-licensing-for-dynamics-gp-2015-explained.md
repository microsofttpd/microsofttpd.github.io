<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage"><img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage" src="https://microsofttpd.github.io/assets/0871.sivav.jpg" width="80" align="right" height="95" /></a><strong>PERPETUAL LICENSING</strong><br />The Perpetual Licensing model, available on Microsoft Dynamics NAV and GP starting with version 2013, provides customers with a simplified, yet flexible, purchase experience.&nbsp; The entire solution can be licensed with as little as one and as much as four core components: The Starter Pack, the Extended Pack, the Full User, the Limited User and the Self-serve User*.. Additional configuration components may also be available.<em><br /></em></p>
<p><em>*Self-serve User only available in Microsoft Dynamics GP on the Perpetual Licensing model</em></p>
<p>The right to deploy the ERP solution&#39;s core functionality is licensed through one required Pack and one optional Pack.&nbsp; The right for users to access the deployed ERP solution functionality is licensed through Client Access Licenses (CALs).&nbsp; Please refer to the Software License Terms and the Licensing Guide for more information. ​</p>
<p><strong>THE STARTER PACK</strong></p>
<p>The required <strong>Starter Pack</strong>gives you core financials and distribution management functionality to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain control and insights over your finances&nbsp;</li>
<li>Manage sales items and materials in a distribution environment</li>
<li>Provide licensed users a singular view of the business from virtually anywhere through a variety of devices</li>
</ul>
<p>And, to top it off, the Starter Pack includes your first three Full Concurrent CALs.&nbsp; For some customers, the Starter Pack is the only module they&#39;ll ever need.&nbsp; ​</p>
<p><strong>THE EXTENDED PACK</strong></p>
<p>The optional and additive Extended Pack adds functionality that integrates the core financials and distribution management capabilities included in the Starter Pack with industry specific functionality extensions.</p>
<p><strong>FULL CONCURRENT CAL</strong></p>
<p>Full Concurrent CALs provide users full read and full write capabilities to all of the licensed solution functionality through any and all modes of access, including the Windows Client, the Web Client, the Microsoft SharePoint Client, or any other mode of access going through the API (including Web Services).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LIMITED CONCURRENT CAL</strong></p>
<p>Limited Concurrent CALs provide users full read but restricted yet powerful write capabilities to all of the licensed solution functionality, subject to some limitations, through any and all modes of access including the Windows and Web Clients. The Limited User license is designed to give you a lower-cost alternative for extending ERP to users who only need to perform limited task as defined in the Licensing Guide.</p>
<p><strong>SELF-SERVE USER CAL</strong></p>
<p>Self-serve User CALs provides access to users that only need to view and modify their own employment data and make purchase requests for their own supplies.&nbsp; Self-serve CALs are licensed per individual and are not concurrent.&nbsp; The Self-serve User is only available for Microsoft Dynamics GP using the Perpetual Licensing model.</p>
<p>Hope this helps&hellip;</p>
<p>Until next post!</p>
