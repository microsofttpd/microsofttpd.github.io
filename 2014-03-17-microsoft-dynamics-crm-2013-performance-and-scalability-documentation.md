<p>This paper focuses on highlighting the scalability that can be achieved in terms of concurrent users, big data and feature functionality.</p>
<p>This paper reflects the scalability and performance achieved on a specific Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013 implementation running on a particular test environment. Factors ranging from specific customizations deployed by enterprise organizations to geographic distribution of users can affect how enterprise organizations use the CRM system, so results will vary for each implementation. Customers might be able to achieve higher levels of performance by fine-tuning or optimization.</p>
<p>Also note that this benchmark focuses on server-side performance and metrics. The response times reported here are for the clients in a laboratory environment without network latency and bandwidth constraints and client-side rendering time that clients might face when they are connected remotely. As a result, response times here are in no way indicative of client responsiveness that might be seen when rendering in a browser.</p>
<p>This paper is very insightful as it covers all the aspect starting from Hardware Environment and Specifications, Enterprise Organization Structure, Testing Methodology, Business unit structure with user distribution, User Data, Transaction Workload, Test&nbsp; Scenarios, Tuning and Optimization, Test Results, Effects Of Hardware Configuration on Performance, and Benchmarking Results Comparison Charts Between Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2013.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Until next post!</p>
