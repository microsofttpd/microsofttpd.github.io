Beginning October 1, 2015, we will no longer provide Technical Presales Assistance and Advisory Services support via partner advisory hours for exclusively on-premises products, with the following exceptions: Windows 10, Windows Server, Microsoft Dynamics AX, and Microsoft SQL.&nbsp; <p>All hybrid scenarios made up of both cloud and on-premises products will continue to be supported. <p>For on-premises only related technical presales or deployment questions, you can find helpful information on our blogs, partner or product related Yammer groups, or by visiting the <a href="http://partnersupport.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Partner Support Community</a> for partner-to-partner guidance.<p>You can find more details on the supported and unsupported technologies in the KB article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3094111" target="_blank">here</a>.<p>Until next post!
