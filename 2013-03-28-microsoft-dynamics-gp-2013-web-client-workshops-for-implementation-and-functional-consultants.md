<p>These courses enable functional and implementation consultants the opportunity to understand the foundation of Microsoft Dynamics GP Web Client, how it functions, the necessary security requirements and how to properly and effectively troubleshoot Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013 on Web Client. If you attend the implementation consultant workshop, we will go deeper to understand and identify the different Web Client deployment options for Microsoft Dynamics GP 2013, the deployed components/services and how they function together, the installation options, tenant services/tenant management and troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<p>We will offer another session each of the Microsoft Dynamics GP Web Client for Functional Consultants and the Microsoft Dynamics GP Web Client for Implementation Consultants classroom training sessions in Fargo on April 29-30 and May 1-3 respectively.</p>
