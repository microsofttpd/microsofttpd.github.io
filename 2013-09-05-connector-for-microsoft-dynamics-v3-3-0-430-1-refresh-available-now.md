<p><strong>Refresh Highlights:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>This refresh addresses the issue of custom fields not being available for mapping on existing maps after the configuration utilities have been run against those mapped entities</li>
<li>Integrations that are saved to template now have their name set to be the same as the file name when they are exported, which allows for importation without errors</li>
<li>Microsoft Dynamics NAV Sales Orders are properly made available for mapping and are set properly as endpoints in those custom mappings</li>
</ol>
