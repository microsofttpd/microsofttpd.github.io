<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage"><img border="0" hspace="10" alt="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage" src="https://microsofttpd.github.io/assets/0871.sivav.jpg" width="80" align="right" height="95" /></a>There has been loads of new features which have been introduced with the latest release of the Dynamics Learning Portal. Some of them are highlighted below.</p>
<p><strong>Access to Lab Environment</strong>&ndash; Users of DLP can connect and work with a virtual machine that is associated to a specific course. Once logged in to the virtual lab, partners will have access to a set of pre-defined Hands-On-Labs (HOL).&nbsp; The default duration for each lab session is 90 minutes with the option to extend it after the timer runs out. After launching the lab and allowing a few minutes for it to fully load, users are presented with a Remote Desktop Connection popup and prompt to log into the virtual machine to consume the HOLs.</p>
<p><strong>​Direct Communication with Partners from within DLP</strong>&ndash; A DLP home page tile will now allow the MBS Readiness team to send out alerts and notifications to DLP users. These short messages will cover items beneficial to partners such as announcements of new course releases, upcoming events, the release of a new lab, or even system warnings.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering and Refine by Language </strong>&ndash; DLP adds &quot;Language&quot; as a new filtering possibility, as well as under the &quot;Refine by&quot; option on the search results.</p>
<p><strong>​Course Sorting</strong>&ndash; Courses displayed by their publication date as opposed to course number. Recently published courses will appear at the top of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Exam Preparation Guide</strong>&ndash; All current English and localized versions of Dynamics Exam Preparation Guides will be available in DLP organized by product version. These documents include the exam number as well as direct links to supplemental training material such as E-Learning courses and instructor-led training that will help you prepare for the exam.</p>
<p><strong>​Course Resources for L200 courses</strong>&ndash; Transition from training manuals to support the E-Learning training experience, new course resources are included in DLP. The training material is a package of documents including Instructor Notes, Classroom Companion Guide and PowerPoints for Classroom. Note that it is not a student manual but collateral material to provide assistance and support to trainers in a classroom environment. This release delivers course resources for L200 courses for Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Microsoft Dynamics AX 2013 R2 and Microsoft Dynamics AX 2013 R3 CU8.</p>

This also includes additional exercises/labs, test your knowledge (TYK), and review areas unique from the E-Learning.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>​​<strong>PowerPoints for Classroom</strong>: these are PowerPoints geared to classroom training and as such, they are different from the PowerPoints that are used in the E-Learning.</li>
