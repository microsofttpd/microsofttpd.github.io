<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage"><img width="80" height="95" align="right" alt="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage" src="https://microsofttpd.github.io/assets/0871.sivav.jpg" border="0" hspace="10" /></a>I have created a few Telegram Messenger groups for various Microsoft Dynamics technologies for increasing efficient collaboration among the community folks. This was created as I was thinking of an different kind of platform apart from communities to interact with the community members.</p>
<p>With the growing demand for social media insight, I decided to use one of the social media networking tool to create a community for Microsoft Dynamics. The reason for choosing Telegram is that people can join with the help of a link and it does not require an administrator to add people to the network, as like other IM&rsquo;s. Also, we can chat from mobiles/laptops/desktops/tablets etc across different platforms and completely free, on the cloud and better encryption of the data... :)</p>
<p>Please join these communities and benefit by closely interacting with community members and experts in a much closer and faster environment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamics CRM</li>
<li>Dynamics AX</li>
<li>Dynamics NAV</li>
<li>Dynamics GP</li>
</ul>
<p>You can join Telegram by clicking the link below.&nbsp;<a href="https://telegram.org/dl" target="_blank">https://telegram.org/dl</a></p>
<p>Once you join, send me an email to&nbsp;<a target="_blank">veeyeskay@gmail.com</a>&nbsp;and I will send you the link to join the group.This is to tighten the security of who joins the group and to avoid spam messages flowing in. Hence the group registrations are a little controlled at this time.</p>
<p>Looking forward for your participation in these groups and increased collaboration in the communities...</p>
