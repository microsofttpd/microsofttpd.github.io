Windows 10 unlocks new experiences for customers to work, play and connect. Windows 10 embodies what our customers (both consumers and enterprises) demand and what we will deliver.</p>
<p>Windows 10 will run across an incredibly broad set of devices &ndash; from the Internet of Things, to servers in enterprise datacenters worldwide. Some of these devices have 4 inch screens &ndash; some have 80 inch screens &ndash; and some don&rsquo;t have screens at all. Some of these devices you hold in your hand, others are ten feet away. Some of these devices you primarily use touch/pen, others mouse/keyboard, others controller/gesture &ndash; and some devices can switch between input types.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not talking about one UI to rule them all &ndash; we&rsquo;re talking about one product family, with a tailored experience for each device.</p>
<p>And across this breadth of devices, we are delivering one application platform for our developers. Whether you&rsquo;re building a game or a line of business application, there will be one way to write a universal app that targets the entire family. There will be one store, one way for applications to be discovered, purchased and updated across all of these devices.</p>
<p>Windows 10 will deliver the right experience on the right device at the right time. It will be our most comprehensive platform ever.</p>
<p>Now, during the design of a new Windows, we spend time with many diverse customers. One of the most important of these customers is the enterprise. In the past year I&rsquo;ve talked to dozens of enterprise customers and listened to how they are using and deploying Windows, and what they need from us.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce the <a href="http://preview.windows.com/" target="_blank">Windows Insider Program</a>, where PC experts and IT Pros can get access to a technical preview of Windows 10 for desktops and laptops. Soon after, we&rsquo;ll also be releasing technical previews of Windows Server and our management tools.</p>
<p>With the Insider program, we&rsquo;re inviting our most enthusiastic Windows customers to shape Windows 10 with us. We know they&rsquo;re a vocal bunch &ndash; and we&rsquo;re looking forward to hearing from them.</p>
<p>The Windows Insider Program is intended for PC experts and IT pros who are comfortable using pre-release software with variable quality. Insiders will receive a steady stream of early builds from us with the latest features we&rsquo;re experimenting with.</p>
<p>Some of the cool features of Windows 10 has been listed below.</p>
<p><strong>Start menu:</strong>The familiar Start menu is back, but it brings with it a new customizable space for your favorite apps and Live Tiles.</p>

<p><strong>Everything runs in a window:</strong>Apps from the Windows Store now open in the same format that desktop apps do and can be resized and moved around, and have title bars at the top allowing for maximize, minimize, and close with a click.</p>

<p><strong>Snap enhancements:</strong>You can now have four apps snapped on the same screen with a new quadrant layout. Windows will also show other apps and programs running for additional snapping and even make smart suggestions on filling available screen space with other open apps.</p>
