<p style="text-align: left;"><a title="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage"><img src="https://microsofttpd.github.io/assets/0871.sivav.jpg" alt="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage" width="80" height="95" align="right" border="0" hspace="10" /></a><a title="Bob Stutz" href="https://community.dynamics.com/members/Bob-Stutz/default.aspx" target="_blank">Bob Stutz</a> announced on 21st January 2012 the broader availability of Microsoft Dynamics CRM December 2012 Service Update in his article <a title="here" href="https://community.dynamics.com/product/crm/crmnontechnical/b/crmconnection/archive/2013/01/21/announcing-microsoft-dynamics-crm-december-2012-service-update.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>After receiving praise from the First Access customers and prospects on the business value which was offered as a part of this release,&nbsp;this release is now rolling out to our full online customer base encompassing thousands of organizations, and is available for new trials and subscriptions in North America, with APAC/EMEA following shortly.</p>
<p>Some of the new features and capabilities of this new service pack update are listed below.</p>
<ul>
<li>A modern, simpler and more intuitive user interface</li>
<li>New configurable sales and service process control</li>
<li>Multiple &nbsp;browser capabilities</li>
<li>Ability to take advantage of Office 2013</li>
<li>Integration with Skype, Bing and Yammer</li>
</ul>
<p>Although these capabilities are available for the online customers through the December 2012 Service Update, there is significant value being delivered for the on-premise customers through the Microsoft Dynamics CRM 2011 Update Rollup 12, which offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple Browser Support</li>
<li>New Bulk Data API</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this information is useful to partners and customers.</p>
<p>Until next post!</p>
