Project "Madeira" connects business processes with the productivity tools in Office 365 to help SMBs grow sales, manage finances and streamline operations. Project "Madeira" is public cloud service (Software as a Service) running on Microsoft Azure. Customers can access the service on the Web, or using apps for <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=734848" target="_blank">Windows</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/project-madeira/id1093325047" target="_blank">iOS</a> or <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=734849" target="_blank">Android</a> devices.

<strong>Project "Madeira" preview is available in the United States market today</strong>. The service is scheduled to become generally available in the U.S. during the second half of 2016, with other countries to follow.

So what do we mean by completely reinvented?
<ul>
	<li><b><strong>A new level of productivity </strong>– </b>Project "Madeira" reduces time wasted switching back and forth between business applications and email. It automatically identifies business context such as invoices and quote requests within Outlook, and presents the user with the tools and data needed to take immediate action – all without leaving Outlook. If you know how to use Office, then you know how to use Project "Madeira."</li>
	<li><b><strong>Cloud first </strong>– </b>Project "Madeira" is designed from the ground up as a true multi-tenant public cloud service on Microsoft Azure, meaning SMBs can get up and running quickly, manage costs and rest assured knowing their data is more protected in hyper-scale, enterprise-class datacenters.</li>
	<li><b><strong>Mobile first</strong> – </b>Project "Madeira" is built for a mobile workforce, with a consistently great user experience across almost any device or form factor. Customers can access the service through a Web browser, or using apps for <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=734848">Windows</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/project-madeira/id1093325047">iOS</a> or <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=734847">Android</a> devices.</li>
	<li><strong>Built for growth </strong><b>–</b> Project "Madeira" is a comprehensive business management solution for growing companies with roughly 10 to 100 employees. These are companies that need more than the simple financial and accounting tools they started with, but aren’t yet ready to make a big investment in a customized enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Without sacrificing ease of use or speed of setup, Project "Madeira" offers a fully powered business management solution in the cloud, with capabilities spanning financials, dimensions, sales and purchase management, inventory, CRM (opportunity management), multi-currency, and business insight. In addition, Microsoft’s ecosystem of independent software vendors are building rich extensions for Project "Madeira." These extensions cover horizontal add-on functionality as well as full industry-specific vertical solutions. They will be available in a marketplace soon.</li>
</ul>
Project "Madeira" will be available in public preview over the next several months as we collect feedback and fine-tune the user experience. The Project "Madeira" team is looking forward to hearing from you! Sign up in seconds now, and use the feedback forums to let us know what you think.
