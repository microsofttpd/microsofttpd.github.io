<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage"><img src="https://microsofttpd.github.io/assets/0871.sivav.jpg" alt="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage" width="80" height="95" align="right" border="0" hspace="10" /></a>The New Business Analyzer is available on the Windows 8 App Store.&nbsp; There are several new features that were added to Business Analyzer, plus we have more we are planning to add in the first half of 2014. This app will become a hub for people who are either casual users of Dynamics GP or don&#39;t even have access.</p>
<p>There is a single end point that all of our apps will connect to.&nbsp; You install the service on your server, so the app will talk to this service. <strong> This is a change from the old business analyzer that had a direct SRS connection. </strong>The strategy around this is when you have other apps that we release or and ISV creates now they can point to the same service.&nbsp; The end user only needs to know the link to the service and then the service knows about everything else making it easy for users to setup.</p>
<p>You can download this service from the link below.</p>
