<p style="text-align:left;"><a title="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage"><img src="https://microsofttpd.github.io/assets/0871.sivav.jpg" alt="Sivakumar Venkataraman - Click for blog homepage" width="80" height="95" align="right" border="0" hspace="10" /></a>Management Reporter CU7 included many new capabilities that provide for strong integrations to Dynamics AX. To make it even easier for Dynamics AX customers to take advantage of these features, Management Reporter can now be installed directly from within Dynamics AX setup.</p>
<ul>
<li>For the current release, Cumulative Update 7 for Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R2, <a href="http://dynamics-ax.blogspot.com/2011/08/ax-2012-slipstreaming-cumulative-update.html" target="_blank">slipstreaming</a> will be required to update existing R2 or newer installations</li>
<li>Any new releases after Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3, Management Reporter will be available in the setup without any additional steps</li>
</ul>
<p>The streamlined setup supports either new Dynamics AX implementations as well as adding Management Reporter to an in-progress or existing implementation. The benefits of this integrated approach to installation include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Answer fewer questions during installation and configuration and don&#39;t answer the same questions in both the Dynamics AX and Management Reporter installations</li>
<li>Automatically add the integration user as a Dynamics AX user with proper permissions</li>
<li>Provide flexibility in determining where the Management Reporter services and client should be installed</li>
</ul>
