This hotfix is more for the data mart deployments of Dynamics ERP.</p>
<p>This hotfix rollup for Management Reporter 2012 for Microsoft Dynamics&reg; ERP resolves issues from Management Reporter 2012 with Rollup 4.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data mart integrations for Microsoft Dynamics GP have been improved for updating transaction records. Updates were also made to better support database collations between Microsoft Dynamics ERP database and the data mart database.</p>
<p>You can download this hotfix from the link below.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you do not have Management Reporter 2012 with Rollup 4 installed, install the Management Reporter server and client components as described in the Management Reporter <a title="installation guide" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=162565" target="_blank">installation guide</a> before configuring the data mart integration.</p>
<p>I hope this benefits the partners and customers who have had issues with the data mart integration which has been resolved in this hotfix.</p>
<p>Until next post!</p>
