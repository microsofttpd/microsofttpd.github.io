If you haven't already, please be sure to read the blog posts from <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/?p=68824" target="_blank">Jujhar Singh</a> and <a href="https://community.dynamics.com/b/msftdynamicsblog/archive/2016/05/22/microsoft-dynamics-crm-spring-2016-wave-now-generally-available-unleashing-the-power-of-one-microsoft-in-the-service-economy" target="_blank">Param Kahlon</a> making the announcement including news about the introduction of field service, project service automation, and portal capabilities as add-ons to Dynamics CRM Online.</p>
With our new field service and project service automation capabilities, organizations have the ability to schedule, manage and deliver onsite service, whether it be their field technician who is supporting multiple customers on a single day, or complex, multi-day projects.
<ul>
	<li>Field Service</li>
	<li>Project Service Automation</li>
</ul>
With our Spring Wave, we introduce portal solutions for companies to engage external communities across customers, employees and partners, providing access to resources and information, streamlining simple tasks and making it easier to get the right help for more difficult problems.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Customer Portal </strong>makes it easy for customers to solve issues on their own with self-service knowledge and other support resources, allowing service agents to focus on issues of greatest impact.</li>
	<li><strong>Community Portal </strong>facilitates peer-to-peer support and deeper relationships between experts in the community, including both internal and external users, while also growing an organizationâ€™s catalog of knowledge and building loyalty.</li>
	<li><strong>Employee Portal</strong> increases employee engagement and productivity with easy access to authoritative and searchable enterprise knowledge for common domains such as IT and HR, and by streamlining common tasks, such as facilities requests.</li>
	<li><strong>Partner Portal </strong>allows businesses to scale through their channel by managing leads, opportunities and communications through established processes.</li>
</ul>
New machine learning scenarios in Microsoft Social Engagement include adaptive learning and automated social triage.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Adaptive learning </strong>determines how a product, a campaign, or a brand is perceived by people on social media, enabling deeper insights into customer behavior</li>
	<li><strong>Automated social triage </strong>automatically detects intention in social posts and routes them as cases or leads into CRM.</li>
</ul>
