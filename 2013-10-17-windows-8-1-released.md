<p>Windows 8.1 brings a variety of new features and improvements to Windows 8 that we think people will really enjoy. We listened to your feedback and are delivering many of the improvements you asked for.</p>
<p>If you are a consumer with a Windows 8 device, <strong>you can now download the free update to Windows 8.1 online through the Windows Store*</strong>. <a href="http://www.windows.com/buy" target="_blank">Please visit Windows.com for everything you need to know including how to get the update</a> for your Windows 8 device. If you are a consumer on a device running Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, or the Windows 8.1 Preview &ndash; <a href="http://www.windows.com/buy" target="_blank">this page on Windows.com</a> will detect your OS and provide you with all the information you need in order to get Windows 8.1 on your device. I also highly recommend <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-8-upgrade" target="_blank">reading our FAQ </a>which answers many of the most common questions about getting Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow October 18th, Windows 8.1 will also be available on new devices and as <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/list/categoryID.66915000?Icid=WindowsCat_Hero_1_preorder_09302013" target="_blank">packaged DVD product</a> at retail locations around the world.

<p>There has been a lot of talk about the new features in Windows 8.1 since the Build conference last June but I think it&rsquo;s worth reiterating the awesomeness that Windows 8.1 brings to your device.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/Win8_1_3row_16x9_US_1D0A4584.png"><img title="Win8-1_3row_16x9_US" src="http://blogs.windows.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/Win8_1_3row_16x9_US_thumb_2E7D370D.png" alt="Win8-1_3row_16x9_US" width="625" height="352" border="0" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/desktop_2BD70C0D.png"><img title="desktop" src="http://blogs.windows.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/desktop_thumb_33F0C913.png" alt="desktop" width="625" height="352" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Start the way you want. The Start screen in Windows 8.1 is more customizable than ever with new tile sizes, new background designs and colors &ndash; allowing you to make the Start screen on your device unique and personal to you (you should see some of the color combinations I&rsquo;ve come up with for my Start screen!). You can also choose how you start your Windows experience &ndash; at the Start screen or the desktop. The Start button is back. And there is an improved Apps view that allows you to see all your apps the way you want.</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.windows.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/Split_Screen_Four_Apps_69F54820.png"><img title="Split Screen Four Apps" src="http://blogs.windows.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-59-23-metablogapi/Split_Screen_Four_Apps_thumb_0457CBE9.png" alt="Split Screen Four Apps" width="625" height="352" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Multi-tasking is even better in Windows 8.1 &ndash; you can now have up to four apps side by side with flexible windows sizing for each app on the screen. At a minimum, I usually have 3 apps snapped side by side on my devices doing various things like email, listening to music and browsing the web. We have also improved multi-monitor support in Windows 8.1 allowing users to view their desktop or apps from the Windows Store on any or all their monitors.</p>

<p>Bing Smart Search is the easiest way to find what you are looking for and to get things done. Built for touch, swipe or type from the Start screen and Smart Search will find what you need &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s a document on your PC, a photo album in the cloud, your favorite app, or a website.</p>
